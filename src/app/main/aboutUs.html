                <p class="text-justify">
                    Flavido is built around the idea that people should have the choice of availing high quality educational content and courses at the click of a button. Educational resources are available in geographical pockets with no easy means of accessing them apart from travelling. We aim at bridging this gap.<br />
                    In this endeavor, our goal is to also lower the cost of education and provide you with new tools of learning.<br/>
                    Flavido ties up with education providers to create a digital library with meaningful resources which includes gists of important books, coaching compilations, digitized or handwritten notes.<br />
                    Flavido sources study material from Educational providers, as well as students like you and provides them at the lowest cost possible.<br />
                    Stay tuned to check out our offerings over next few weeks!<br /><br />
